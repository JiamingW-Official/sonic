# Add-Only Policy for Sound Matrix / Sonic

## Rule

- **Only add** new functionality, visuals, or effects. Do not remove, simplify, or disable existing features or effects unless the user **explicitly allows or requests** removal.
- If a change would remove, replace, or reduce an existing feature (e.g. a visual effect, interaction, mode, or audio behavior), either:
  - Propose an additive alternative (e.g. add a new option while keeping the old behavior), or
  - Ask: "This would remove [X]. Do you want me to remove it?"
- Preserve all existing: keyboard/mouse/touch/gyro/head-tracking interactions, post-processing (kaleidoscope, bloom, glitch, mirror, warp, etc.), particle systems, KEY_PROFILES, ambient/arp/mic modes, and audio chain.

## Rationale

The project is a rich, feature-dense experience; removals can unintentionally strip intended behavior. Default to extending, not replacing.
